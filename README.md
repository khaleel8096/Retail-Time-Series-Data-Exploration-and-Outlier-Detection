# Retail-Time-Series-Data-Exploration-and-Outlier-Detection

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail time series data, exploring insights, and implementing outlier detection techniques to ensure data integrity and enhance analytical outcomes. The dataset used is aimed at forecasting sales trends and identifying anomalies that could affect business decisions.

## Contents

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Importing and understanding the dataset using Pandas.
   - Conversion of date columns and feature engineering for temporal analysis.
   - Handling missing values to maintain data completeness.
   - Visualization of sales trends across categories, regions, and shipping modes.

2. **Outlier Detection Methods**
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Identifying outliers based on statistical quartiles.
   - **Z-Score Method**: Detecting outliers using standard deviation thresholds.
   - **Isolation Forest**: Using a machine learning algorithm to isolate anomalies.
   - **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Assessing deviations in local densities.
   - **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: Determining outliers based on distance to neighbors.

3. **Results and Visualizations**
   - Visual representation of outliers detected by each method.
   - Comparative analysis of sales trends with and without outlier removal.
   - Impact assessment on total sales by category and region.

4. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of the project's findings and the importance of outlier detection in retail analytics.

## Usage

### Dependencies
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`: Data manipulation and visualization.
- `scipy.stats`, `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest`, `sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor`: Libraries for outlier detection methods.
- `tqdm`: Optional for progress tracking.

### Setup
1. **Data Import**: Load the dataset (`train.csv`) using Pandas.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
   ```

2. **Exploration and Preprocessing**: Explore data structure, handle missing values, and prepare for analysis.

   ```python
   # Example: Convert date columns
   df['Order Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Order Date'], format='%d/%m/%Y')
   df['Ship Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Ship Date'], format='%d/%m/%Y')
   ```

3. **Outlier Detection**: Implement various methods (IQR, Z-Score, Isolation Forest, LOF, kNN) to detect outliers in sales data.

   ```python
   # Example: IQR Method
   Q1 = df['Sales'].quantile(0.25)
   Q3 = df['Sales'].quantile(0.75)
   IQR = Q3 - Q1
   ```

4. **Visualization**: Plot graphs to visualize sales trends and outliers.

   ```python
   # Example: Plot total sales by category
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   category_sales = df.groupby('Category')['Sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
   category_sales.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
   plt.title('Total Sales by Category')
   plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
   plt.xticks(rotation=45)
   plt.show()
   ```

5. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and insights gained from the analysis.
